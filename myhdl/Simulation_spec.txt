Specification for the Simulation class
--------------------------------------

* The Simulation object constructor has an arbitrary number of
  arguments with each argument being a generator, or a hierchical
  sequence of generators. With a "hierarchical" sequence I mean a
  sequence whose elements may themselves be sequences, and so on, down
  to an arbitrary level.

* A Simulation object has a 'run(duration=None)' method. If a duration
  is specified, it should be a positive integer that indicates that
  the simulation should run for that amount of time. If not, it should
  run until there are no further events. Consecutive runs for a number
  of durations t1, t2, ... tn should give exactly the same behavior as
  a single run for duration t1+t2+...+ tn. The 'run' method returns
  None if there are no further events, and 1 otherwise. When the
  simulation has run for the specified duration, the StopSimulation
  exception is raised.

* When there are no further events during as simulation run, the
  StopSimulation exception is raised.

* When the StopSimulation exception is caught, the run method prints
  the exception message and returns True.
