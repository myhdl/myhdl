Specification for the intbv class
---------------------------------

Hardware description languages need bit-oriented data types. The
standard Python int and long types have most of the desired features,
including bitwise operations and an underlying 2-s complement
representation, except one: mutability. Hardware designers want to be
able to set bits and slices of a bit vector. The intbv class provides
such a mutable number. It is designed to work transparently as a
number, with other intbv's and with ints and longs. In addition, it
has indexing and slicing operations and a few other bit-oriented
features. As it is mutable, it cannot be a subtype of int; so it is a
separate type.

* an intbv(arg) constructor takes and int, long, intbv, or bit string
  as its argument. The bit string works as in int(bit string, 2).

* an intbv supports the same the numeric, comparison, bitwise and
  conversion operators as ints and longs. It supports mixed-type
  operations with ints and longs, that always return an intbv.

* an intbv supports indexing operations, both to get and set a bit.

* an intbv supports slicing operations, both to get and set a
  slice. As is customary in hardware design, and unlike Python
  sequences, the rightmost bit has index 0, and a slice is taken by a
  downward range; in other words, in [i:j], i has to be larger than
  j. People may object to this as it departs from standard Python
  sequence conventions. However, an intbv should not be seen as a
  sequence, but as a number in the first place: the indexing/slicing
  operations are borrowed to get/set individual bits in a number. It
  seems natural that the index of a bit should equal the power of the
  corresponding 2**i term in a representation of the number's value as
  a sum of powers of 2. This is also the standard hardware design way
  to look at it.

* As in standard Python, ranges are half-open; however, the
  not-included index is the left index. Only the right index can be
  left unspecified and defaults to zero: in that case the left index
  is equals the number of bits taken. Provided the downward range
  concept is accepted, this seems like the Pythonic way to do it. Just
  like with sequences, this convention avoids one-off issues in a lot
  of practical cases.

* When setting slices, there should be check on the input value to
  verify that all significant bits can be accepted by the slice.

* intbv has a concat method that can concatenate intbv arguments. It
  may be clearest to use this as an unbound method. The first argument
  can be any intbv. However, for subsequent arguments there has to be
  some way to derive the amount of bits. Therefore, the intbv returned
  by an indexing or slicing operation should remember how many bits
  were taken, so that they can be using in concatenations. In
  addition, literal bit strings are accepted in concatenations, just as
  they are in intbv constructors.

* intbv supports the iterator protocol to iterate on its bits; again,
  this requires a known length.
