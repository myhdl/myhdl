What's new in MyHDL 0.9
***********************

Python 3 Support
================
Experimental Python 3 support has been added to MyHDL 0.9

See :doc:`/python3` for more info.

Interfaces (Conversion of attribute accesses)
=============================================

Rationale
---------
Complex designs often have many signals (ports) that are passed to 
different levels of hierarchy.  Typically, many of the signals can 
logically be grouped together.  Grouping the signals into an 
*interface* simplifies the code, improves efficiency, and reduces 
errors.

An *interface* is a collection of signals (:class:`Signal`)  embedded 
in an class/object as attributes.  This provides a natural method 
to group related signals and provides intuitive access through 
attributes.  Multiple level of objects and attributes provides a 
hierarchy of signal structure if desired.

The following is an example of an *interface* definition::

    class Complex:
        def __init__(self, min=-2, max=2):
	    self.real = Signal(intbv(0, min=min, max=max))
	    self.imag = Signal(intbv(0, min=min, max=max))


Although previous versions supported *interfaces* for modeling,
`MyHDL generator`_\s which directly referenced attributes were not 
convertible. 
MyHDL now supports conversion of designs which contain attribute accesses.

The following 
is an example using the above ``Complex`` interface definition::

    a,b = Complex(-8,8), Complex(-8,8)
    c = Complex(-128,128)

    def complex_multiply(clock, reset, a, b, c):

        @always_seq(clock.posedge, reset=reset)
        def cmult():
            c.real.next = (a.real*b.real) - (a.imag*b.imag)
	    c.imag.next = (a.real*b.imag) + (a.imag*b.real)

	return cmult
	           

Solution
--------
The proposed solution is to create unique names for attributes which 
are used by `MyHDL generator`_\s.  The converter will create a unique 
name by using the name of the parent 
and the name of the attribute along with the name of the MyHDL module 
instance (if required for uniqueness).  The converter will essentially 
replace the "." with an "_" for each *interface* element.  

Even though the target HDLs do not support *interfaces*, MyHDL is
able to add high-level features that compile during conversion to the 
target HDL (Verilog and VHDL).  


Conversion
----------

.. add details of the conversion, what policies are used to name 
.. extend the Signals.  Any useful information about the approach
.. or structure in the converter used.


Limitations
-----------
Currently, MyHDL only converts interfaces in the form of attribute accesses.
Dictionaries are not yet supported.
