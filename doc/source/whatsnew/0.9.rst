Interfaces
===========

Rationale
---------
Complex designs often have many signals (ports) that are passed to 
different levels of hierarchy.  Typically, many of the signals can 
logically be grouped together.  Grouping the signals into an 
*interface* simplifies the code, improves efficiency, and reduces 
errors.

An *interface* is a collection of signals (:class:`Signal`)  embedded 
in an class/object as attributes.  This provides a natural method 
to group related signals and provides intuitive access through 
attributes.  Multiple level of objects and attibutes provides a 
hierarchy of signal structure if desired.

The following is an example of an *interface* definition::

    class Complex:
        def __init__(self, min=-2, max=2):
	    self.real = Signal(intbv(0, min=min, max=max))
	    self.imag = Signal(intbv(0, min=min, max=max))


Previous versions supported *interfaces* for modeling and for 
conversion if the attributes were locally referenced in a MyHDL 
module outside of the `MyHDL generator`_.  If the attributes were 
directly referenced in the `MyHDL generator`_ the code would not be 
convertible.

This features adds the ability to convert attributes that are 
:class:`Signal` and referenced in the `MyHDL generator`_.  This is
an evolution of a useful construct.  

The following 
is an example using the above ``Complex`` interface definition::

    a,b = Complex(-8,8), Complex(-8,8)
    c = Complex(-128,128)

    def complex_multiply(clock, reset, a, b, c):

        @always_seq(clock.posedge, reset=reset)
        def cmult():
            c.real.next = (a.real*b.real) - (a.imag*b.imag)
	    c.imag.next = (a.real*b.imag) + (a.imag*b.real)

	return cmult
	           

Solution
--------
The proposed solution is to create unique names for attributes which 
are type :class:`Signal` and used by a `MyHDL generator`_.  The 
converter will create a unique name by using the name of the parent 
and the name of the attribute along with the name of the MyHDL module 
instance (if required for uniqueness).  The converter will essentially 
replace the "." with an "_" for each *interface* element.  

Even though the target HDLs do not support *interfaces*, MyHDL is
able to add high-level features that compile during conversion to the 
target HDL (Verilog and VHDL).  


Conversion
----------

.. add details of the conversion, what policies are used to name 
.. extend the Signals.  Any useful information about the approach
.. or structure in the converter used.


Limitations
-----------
The current implementation only converts ``Signal`` attributes and 
constants (read-only ints).  Other Python structures will not be 
analyzed (e.g. dict) and attributes used as variables will not be
converted.
