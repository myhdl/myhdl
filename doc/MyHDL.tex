\begin{abstract}

\noindent

\myhdl\ is a Python package for using Python as a hardware description
language. Popular hardware description languages, like Verilog and
VHDL, are compiled languages. \myhdl\ with Python could be viewed as a
"scripting language" counterpart of such languages. However, Python is
more accurately described as a very high level language
(VHLL). \myhdl\ users have access to the amazing power and elegance of
Python in their modeling work.

The key idea behind \myhdl\ is to use Python generators to model the
concurrency required in hardware descriptions. As generators are a
recent Python feature, \myhdl\ requires Python 2.2.2. or higher.

\myhdl\ 0.1 is the initial public release of the package. It can be
used experiment with high level modeling, and with verification
techniques such as unit testing. 

In a future release, \myhdl\ will
hopefully be coupled to hardware simulators for languages such as
Verilog and VHDL. That would turn \myhdl\ into a powerful hardware
verification language.
